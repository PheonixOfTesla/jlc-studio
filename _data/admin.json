  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How far in advance should I book your services?",
      "answer": "For weddings and large events, we recommend booking 6-12 months in advance to ensure availability and allow time for detailed planning. Smaller events can often be accommodated with 2-4 weeks notice, depending on availability. For alterations and custom tailoring, we can often accommodate rush services for an additional fee."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer consultations?",
      "answer": "Yes! We offer complimentary initial consultations (30 minutes via phone or video) to discuss your vision and determine if we're the right fit for your project. For in-depth planning sessions, we charge a consultation fee that's credited toward your final project."
    },
    {
      "question": "What areas do you serve?",
      "answer": "We're based in Sarasota and serve the surrounding areas including Bradenton, Venice, Lakewood Ranch, and beyond. Travel fees may apply for distant locations (typically $50-200 depending on distance). We also travel nationally for weddings and large events."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I combine multiple services?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Our unique triple-service model means you can have coordinated florals, decor, and tailoring from one creative vision. We offer special package pricing for combined services. This ensures complete cohesion across all elements of your event."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is your cancellation policy?",
      "answer": "Cancellations more than 60 days before an event receive a full refund (minus any non-refundable vendor fees). Cancellations 30-60 days prior incur a 25% cancellation fee. Cancellations within 30 days are non-refundable. Deposits are always non-refundable. We offer event date changes for a small fee."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work with specific vendors or venues?",
      "answer": "We've established relationships with most major venues in the area and work seamlessly with photographers, caterers, planners, and other vendors. We can recommend trusted partners or work with your existing team. We're experienced in venue logistics and coordinate all deliveries and setup."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle custom colors or themes?",
      "answer": "Custom color palettes and themes are our specialty! During consultation, we discuss your vision, aesthetic preferences, and practical considerations. We provide mood boards, fabric swatches, and color samples. Our design process ensures your vision is perfectly executed across all elements."

      "question": "What's included in your day-of coordination?",
