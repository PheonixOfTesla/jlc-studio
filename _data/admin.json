    "bio": "With 15+ years mastering the intersection of fashion, florals, and event design, JLynne brings an unmatched eye for color, texture, and detail to every creation. Her journey began in Manhattan's fashion elite—developing seasonal collections for Elise Overland, managing the prestigious Silk Department at Mood Fabrics, and designing for celebrity clients including Sarah Jessica Parker and Katie Holmes. She assisted on multiple seasons of Project Runway and worked backstage at Fashion Week with legendary designers Yigal Azrouel and Cynthia Rowley. This couture-level precision now elevates every floral arrangement, event installation, and custom garment she creates. Born in the U.S. and raised in Sweden with years spent in Israel, JLynne's international perspective infuses her work with a sophisticated global aesthetic. She believes art is a tool for expression, healing, and community creativity—and that belief transforms ordinary events into unforgettable experiences.",
